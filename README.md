# Dragon Crypto

A new cryptosystem that uses the Dragon Curve Fractal for encrypting and decrypting text messages. The research paper can be obtained from here: https://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume176/number29/31386-2020920331

In recent years cyber-attacks are continuously developing.
This means that hackers can find their way around the
traditional cryptosystems. This calls for new and more secure
cryptosystems to take their place. This paper outlines a new
cryptosystem based on the dragon curve fractal. The security
level of this scheme is based on multiple private keys, that are
crucial for effective encryption and decryption of data. This
paper discusses, how core concepts emerging from fractal
geometry can be used as a trapdoor function for this
cryptosystem.
